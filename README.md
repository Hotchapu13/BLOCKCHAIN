# BASIC BLOCKCHAIN IMPLEMENTATION IN JAVA

This is not a fully functional blockchain but a proof of understanding of what a blockchain is.

## UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF THE BLOCKCHAIN

A blockchain is basically a chain of blocks (as defined by the name itself). 

Each block contains a hash that holds its digital signature, the prevHash variable to hold the previous block's hash and data variable to hold the block's data.
