# BASIC BLOCKCHAIN IMPLEMENTATION IN JAVA

This is not a fully functional blockchain but a proof of understanding of what a blockchain is.

## UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF THE BLOCKCHAIN

A blockchain is basically a chain of blocks (as defined by the name itself). Each block contains data specific to that block, its digital fingerprint (hash) and the digital fingerprint of the previous block.

The digital fingerprint can be called a hash.
